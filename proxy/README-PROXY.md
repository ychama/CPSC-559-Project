# CPSC-559-Project Load Balancer Implementation

The load balancers process is implemented with nodejs using HTTP for communication. This is a lightweight process that is responsible for routing users to a server process and keeping a list of available servers through checking the health.

The health logic and logic to return server addresses is in the `server.js` file.

Please refer to the report for more details.
